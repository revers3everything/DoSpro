# DoSpro

**DoSpro** is a tool designed to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by dynamically changing the IP address every 10 seconds to bypass Web Application Firewall (WAF) blocks or bans. This tool leverages **Free Windscribe VPN** to cycle through different IP addresses and **slowhttptest** to execute the DoS attack.
